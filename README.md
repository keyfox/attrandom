# Attrandom

An easy line-by-line text picker.

## Usage

1. Go to [Attrandom](https://keyfox.github.io/attrandom/).
1. Drop a text file which you'd like to pick a line from onto the app.
   - NOTE: Processing a larger file takes longer time.
   - The file encoding must be UTF-8.
1. Click ðŸŽ² as many times as you want to.
   The app picks a line of the text file randomly and shows it.

## Is "Attrandom" is a typo for "Atrandom?"

**Nope.**
This app is originally supposed to be used for picking an _attribute_.
